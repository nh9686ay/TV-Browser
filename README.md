## Requirements

For this assignment you'll be building a JSON API using express, from scratch. The provided starter files are here just to give you a guideline - you must create everything that isn't the seed data.

> All this data was pulled from the TV Maze API. It's pretty great! http://www.tvmaze.com/api

Run `node db/getPeople.js`. This will retrieve a list of 20 random people from the API. If it fails, wait 10 seconds and try again.

- Using the newly retrieved people data (in `db/people.json`), build out the Person model. Include all of the properties.
- Build out the Show model. The following properties are just SOME of the ones you will need to have in your model ... examine your data to determine all of the properties the Show model will need:
  - url
  - name
  - language
  - genres
  - status
  - runtime
  - rating
  - weight
  - all image links
  - summary
- Write the logic to seed the database with both datasets. You can do each individually if its easier.
- Set up your express server, routes, and controller. Put `/api` as the prefix to all your routes.

Your server should have the following routes/endpoints. How you choose to name them is up to you. You should follow the standard HTTP verb / action convention, e.g. using GET for retrieving data and POST for writing data.

- List all shows/people
- List a single show/person by id
- Create a show/person
- Update a single show/person by id
- Delete a show/person by id

This means you will have a total of 12 routes! 6 for each model.

Remember to use Postman, it's a good friend to rely on during these trying times.

## Bonus

- Update your `list all shows` method to only return some of the properties, for example: name, id, url, summary. the `list a single show by id` method should return everything.
- Update your `list a single show by name` method to be more flexible in searching. For example, you could convert everything to lowercase, and get creative with how you compare if names are equal.

## Double Bonus

Add a third model for episodes. Reference the episodes to the shows by id (you may have to add the id back in to the shows). Then pick 10 or so shows and populate your database with them, using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to help you make requests and the new Episode model to write to the database.
